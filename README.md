Try to solve Advent of Code 2022 while learning rust.

Each directory `day*` is a crate with a binary.
Each binary takes `{prob1|prob2}` as an argument, followed by `input.txt`, my unique problem input.
The website examples are used as unit test inputs.
For example: `cd day1; cargo test; cargo run prob1 input.txt`
