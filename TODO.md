# Presently
Day 11:
Prob1 is solved.
Fix overflow for prob2.

# Later
Problem 22 looks interesting - can try using an ordered map crate to represent the tree, or use a tree data structure crate.

# After AoC

I would like to write a Mandelbrot set generator in rust.
- do on mac with egui graphics and zooming
- Explore different types of parallelism - basic, ILP, multi-core, simd (RPi 4b has vectors too).  
- use Rayon for parallelism, also SIMD.
