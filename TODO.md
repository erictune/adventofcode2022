# Presently
Day 11:
Prob1 is solved.
Fix overflow for prob2.

# Later
Problem 22 looks interesting - can try using an ordered map crate to represent the tree, or use a tree data structure crate.

# After AoC

I would like to write a quick Mandelbrot set generator, 
and then extend it to allow different threads to work 
on blocks of the image in parallel.  Looks like iced.rs is a good ui library.
