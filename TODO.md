# Presently
Write an "FinalBlankOnly line iterator"
Write a tuple-yielding iterator for files with fixed number fixed-typed of items per line.

Consider writing a directional iterator method, which could complement the grid crate:
Grid::iter_dir({N|S|E|W}, start_x, start_y) : returns an iterator that moves up, down, left or right starting from a point on the grid.

# After AoC

I would like to write a quick Mandelbrot set generator, 
and then extend it to allow different threads to work 
on blocks of the image in parallel.
